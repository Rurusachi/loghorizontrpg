# Log Horizon TRPG System

This is a Log Horizon TRPG game system for Foundry VTT.

This system is built on the Boilerplate System by Asacolips.
Some code is based on Atropos' dnd5e system.
Extended active effect functionality adapted from Tim Posney's Dynamic Active Effects.
They have been very helpful resources to understand how Foundry works.

You can toggle active effects in the active effect tab.  
Style skills have conditional effects on by default. If you do not fulfill the condition turn off the corresponding effect.
