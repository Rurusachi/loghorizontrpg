# Log Horizon TRPG System

This is a Log Horizon TRPG game system for Foundry VTT.

This system is built on the Boilerplate System by Asacolips.
Some code is based on Atropos' dnd5e system.
Extended active effect functionality adapted from Tim Posney's Dynamic Active Effects.
They have been very helpful resources to understand how Foundry works.
